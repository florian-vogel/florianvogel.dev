function:
two modes: single and multiple users

first implement basic pomodoro idea (sigle mode)
-> timer, tasks, notes
    - tasks is a extended todo list feature (e.g. folder structure to organize multiple
    todo lists)
-> useraccount, authentication, data sync
    - note: timer should be synced as well across multiple devices (realtime db)
-> show statistics about and display how good the technique is working (maybe show intresting
facts about recent progress)

then extend to second mode (multiple users)
-> user can create 'room' to which others can join via a code (see kahoot)
-> creator has multiple settings about what others are allowed to do
    - if creator allows users can see their todolists and can take notes
    - if creator allows, users can control timer
    

style:
animated timer
clean style, maybe use the
